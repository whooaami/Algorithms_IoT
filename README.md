<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>My task is to implement a sorting algorithm. The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma and can be run as follows</p> 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<p>The code must be able to sort in ascending order. and descending<br>
The result should display:<br>
1)the name of the algorithm<br>
2)work time<br>
3)the number of comparison operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm<br>
4)the number of exchange operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm<br>
5)sorting results</p>
